## ActiveMatter AI

### Our Mission

Inspired by the rapidly growing capabilities of artificial intelligence in medicine, we at ActiveMatter AI are dedicated to developing and deploying cutting edge algorithmic technology to improve protein-based drug discovery pipelines. Ultimatley, we hope that our technology can aid in the discovery of life-saving drugs.

### What we do?

ActiveMatter AI provides clients with state-of-the-art algorithmic capabilities that optimize candidate identification in the early stages of drug discovery. Our computational models enable clients to develop enhanced antibody candidates at high throughput and significantly decreased cost. Using our technology, clients can minimize the time and money spent developing promising candidates and focus on pushing candidates towards testing and commercialization.


### Why us?

Using cutting-edge techniques in protein language model development, ActiveMatter AI possesses the algorithmic capabilities to produce enhanced antibody candidates. These candidates are not only high in affinity to the antigen of interest but display desired performance in other important categories such as toxicity and cross-reactivity. In this way, our models have learned the complex multi-variate task of designing antibody candidates that could ultimately translate to drugs usable in the human body.

### Who are we?

ActiveMatter AI was founded at UC Berkeley by a team of research scientists and engineers committed to improving the drug discovery pipeline using artificial intelligence.
